# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis on data for Pyber, a Python-based ridesharing app company. The goal is to produce visualizations and analysis that will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine afforadibility for underserved neighborhoods. This project utilizes Pandas libraries, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to produce these visualizations. 

The dataset was provided in two large CSV files: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv. The file city_data.csv had three columns of data: the city name, the driver count, and the type of city (Urban, Suburban, or Rural). The file ride_data.csv had four columns of data: the city name, the date, the fare amount, and the ride id number. The city_data.csv file had 120 rows of entries in the dataset while the ride_data.csv file had 2375 entries. 
### Resources
